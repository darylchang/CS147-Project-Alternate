<h1>Delp user testing</h1>
<h5>Daryl Chang, Arushi Jain, and Keith Wyngarden for CS147</h5>

  <h3>Plan</h3>
  <p>We will ask two people about to go to lunch/dinner to evalaute Delp. We have received feedback through several channels that certain features of the app seem somewhat hidden, so our tasks will be designed so that the key features of the app (map, search, favorites) are particularly useful for  one task each. The ease of accessing these features (and the navigation paths taken by the user) will help us figure out what functionality needs to be emphasized in our redesign.</p>

  <p>Task 1 asks users to locate the three closest dining halls, then find some more information about a particular hall. Rather than manually searching the list of halls, we expect users to find the "Nearby" page in the menu and use our map's functionality to complete this task. The second part of the task will require navigation to a dining hall's page. The idea is that users about to go to a meal will want to explore the most practical (closest and open) options first.</p>

  <p>Task 2 asks users to browse for their favorite food items and list all the dining halls serving several items. This task helps test the homepage's interactive features, but more critically, it tests how intuitive the "search for multiple items/tags" approach is. Ideally, we'd like users to quickly learn to type in things like "chicken parmesan beans chocolate".</p>

  <p>Task 3 asks users to test our "input" - likes/dislikes and favorites. This requires navigating to a food page and understanding that the icons are interactive buttons. Crucially, it also tests whether or not the idea of "index by favoriting" is intuitive to users. This tasks is possible by manually searching for an item and browsing the results, but it is made much easier by navigating to the favorites page, where a complete list of matching halls is shown.</p>

  <h3>Task Description (read aloud to participant)</h3>
  <p>Thank you for agreeing to test Delp. To expedite the test, we have created a new user account that you can access with your SUNet ID. We will now ask you to complete several tasks using Delp. After giving you each task, we will not intervene except to answer any questions you may have. As a reminder, we will be taking photographs during this user test.</p>

  <p>1. Identify the three closest dining halls to your current location, and find the hours and menu of the closest hall.</p>

  <p>2. Browse Delp to find your favorite three food items, and list all the dining halls that serve these items.</p>

  <p>3. You went to one of the dining halls serving these items, and particulary liked one of them. Give a "Like" and a "Favorite" to this item, then find all dining halls serving it.</p>
