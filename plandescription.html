<h1>Delp user testing</h1>
<h5>Daryl Chang, Arushi Jain, and Keith Wyngarden for CS147</h5>

  <h3>Plan</h3>
  <p>We will ask two people about to go to lunch/dinner to evalaute Delp. We have received feedback through several channels that certain features of the app seem somewhat hidden, so our tasks will be designed so that the key features of the app (map, search, favorites) are particularly useful for  one task each. The ease of accessing these features (and the navigation paths taken by the user) will help us figure out what functionality needs to be emphasized in our redesign.</p>

  <p>Task 1 asks users to locate the three closest dining halls, then find some more information about a particular hall. Rather than manually searching the list of halls, we expect users to find the "Nearby" page in the menu and use our map's functionality to complete this task. The second part of the task will require navigation to a dining hall's page. The idea is that users about to go to a meal will want to explore the most practical (closest and open) options first.</p>

  <p>Task 2 will first test the interactive features of the homepage and the food pages. Users will need to understand that the icons on the food page are clickable buttons. More critically, it will ask users to discover some way of accessing concise information for several items. This task is intended to unearth either the favorites page (easy and prompted) or multi-item searches (perhaps less intuitive).</p>

  <p>Task 3 asks users to understand the search bar. It will require the user to understand tags. It will require the user to understand in some sense that the search bar is flexible in its input - it can match partial food items and tags, and combine multiple pieces in a single search. A possible way to solve this task is to individually search for specific food items; if this happens, we need to make search even more prominent and give better examples in the prompt text.</p>

  <h3>Task Description (read aloud to participant)</h3>
  <p>Thank you for agreeing to test Delp. To expedite the test, we have created a new user account that you can access with your SUNet ID. We will now ask you to complete several tasks using Delp. After giving you each task, we will not intervene except to answer any questions you may have. As a reminder, we will be taking photographs during this user test.</p>

  <p>1. Identify the three closest dining halls to your current location, and find the hours and menu of the closest hall.</p>

  <p>2. Browse Delp to find your favorite three food items, like and favorite them, and find where these items are served.</p>

  <p>3. Please find all dining halls serving either [choose tags/partial names related to user's favorites, like "vegetarian or biscuits"].</p>
